# trojan

An unidentifiable mechanism that helps you bypass GFW.

Trojan features multiple protocols over `TLS` to avoid both active/passive detections and ISP `QoS` limitations.

Trojan is not a fixed program or protocol. It's an idea, an idea that imitating the most common service, to an extent that it behaves identically, could help you get across the Great FireWall permanently, without being identified ever. We are the GreatER Fire; we ship Trojan Horses.  

This is a forked version of trojan, which is optimized for running as a server.
